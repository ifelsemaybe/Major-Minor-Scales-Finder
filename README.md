# Major-Minor-Scales-Finder

This here project is a musical scale finder as the title suggests. You input a certain root note for which you'd want either the major scale or minor scale to be shown back to you.

I personally use it when I'm working on some music and want a quick reference as to what notes I can play along within a major or minor scale.

The 12 different (root) notes for which you can show a scale are: {A, A#, B, C, C#, D, D#, E, F, F#, G, G#}

If you are running on Windows, inside the folder path "out\artifacts\Major_and_Minor_scales_jar" there is a run.bat file which if you double click will run this app for you in command prompt, granted that you have java jdk installed on your computer.

The compiled .jar file is also located inside this folder path.

This project was built using Intellij on Windows, and is coded entirely with Java.

## Example:

Note: notice you can type M for major scale and m for minor scale, as a shortcut.
